in order for editors or applications to make sure that the file they are using is Markdown-formatted,  
we could use some of the most common file extensions, such as .md, .mkdn, or .markdown.  
### Step 1 – Inserting paragraph and line breaks
### Step 2 – Inserting headers #  
There are two styles for declaring headers in Markdown: setext and atx.  
#### Setext style  
header 1  
--------
#### Atx style  
##### header 5  
### Step 3 – Inserting emphasis  
Markdown treats asterisks (*) and underscores (_) as indicators of emphasis. A single symbol is  
used for italics and a double symbol for bold:  
*single asterisks*  
_single underscores_  
**double asterisks**  
__double underscores__  
### Step 4 – Inserting lists  
#### Ordered lists  
Ordered lists use numbers as list markers:  
1. One  
2. Two  
6. Six
#### Unordered lists
Unordered lists use asterisks (*), plus signs (+), and hyphens (-) as list markers:
* A list.  
* Second element.
+ A new entry.
- Another entry in a list.
- And the list goes on.

#### Nested lists
List can be nested as follows:

- First level
  - Second level
    - Third level
  - Second level again  
### Step 5 – Inserting links
Markdown supports two styles of links: inline and reference. In both styles, the link text is  
delimited by square brackets ([ and ]) and the title attribute is optional.
