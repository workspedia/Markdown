Markdown is a simple way to add headings, links, and rich formatting to plain text documents and convert them to perfect HTML files.
plain text documents 
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that simplifies the workflow of web writers. 
It was created in 2004.

Markdown was described by John Gruber as:
"A text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an
easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML(or HTML)."

Markdown is two different things:
(1) A simple syntax to create documents in plain text
(2) A software tool written in Perl that converts the plain text formatting to HTML

The following code is written in HTML:
<h1>Markdown</h1>
